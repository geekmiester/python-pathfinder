# Pygame Pathfinder

Visualise maze generation and pathfinding algorithms with Pygame.

## Installation

After cloning the repo, you need to set up and activate an virtual enviornment.

To Create and activate your virtual environment:

- On MacOS/Linux:

```bash
virtualenv --no-site-packages env
source env/bin/activate
```

- On Windows:

```bash
virtualenv env
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

Install the required packages:

-pip install -r requirements.txt

### Use the program

got to the program folder and simply run the 'grid.py' file
python grid.py

#### Buttons

Maze/terrain generation buttons are on the right.

##### Maze/terrain generation examples:

![Recursive division](gifs/recursive-division-generation.gif)
![Alternate Prim's algorithm](gifs/alternate-prim-generation.gif)
![Terrain generation](gifs/terrain-generation.gif)

Pathfinding buttons are on the left.

##### Pathfinding examples:

###### Dijkstra's algorithm (equivalent to BFS in this case)

![Dijkstra's algorithm](gifs/dijkstra-on-prim.gif)

###### Depth first search (DFS)

![DFS](gifs/dfs-on-prim.gif)

###### A\* algorithm

The visualise button is a toggle.

###### Grid interaction

Left click to create a wall or move the start and end points.

Hold left <kbd>CTRL</kbd> and left click to create a sticky mud patch (which reduces movement speed to 1/3).

The point of these mud patches is to showcase Dijkstra's algorithm (first) and A\* (second) by adjusting the "distances" between the nodes:

![A* on mud](gifs/astar-on-mud.gif)

After a pathfinding algorithm has been run you can drag the start/end points around and see the visualisation update instantly for the new path using the algorithm that was last run.
